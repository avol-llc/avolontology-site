      <h2 id="what-the-valuelens-number-means">What The ValueLens™ Number Means</h2>
      <p>The ValueLens number is a standardized representation of applicable non-price components associated with a purchasing option, expressed as a dollar-denominated figure.</p>

      <p>It is calculated using predefined, mathematically based rules applied to the option’s current value components known at the time of evaluation, which update as the underlying input values change.</p>

      <p>The figure is generated mechanically and reflects a context-agnostic representation of value. Value components associated with user-specific inputs or entitlements can be reflected when those inputs are supplied by the presenting platform.</p>

      <h2 id="what-goes-into-the-valuelens-number">What Goes Into The ValueLens™ Number</h2>
      <p>The ValueLens number reflects quantifiable value components associated with an option, based on inputs that are measurable and known at the time an option is evaluated, such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Direct financial adjustments (cashback, rebates, credits, etc.)</li>
        <li>Cost-related components (shipping charges, warranties, bundled services, etc.)</li>
        <li>Included benefits or entitlements that carry measurable value</li>
        <li>Loyalty points or rewards associated with the option</li>
        <li>Other objectively quantifiable components that can be resolved at the time of evaluation</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Component unit values are derived from verifiable, externally defined, and/or issuer-provided sources and updated to reflect current reference values.</p>

    <section aria-labelledby="what-valuelens-does-not-do">
      <h2 id="what-valuelens-does-not-do">What ValueLens™ Does Not Do</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide advice or recommendations</li>
        <li>Determine which option should be selected</li>
        <li>Rank or order options</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The size of the number does not, by itself, imply that one option should be selected over another. Any comparison, sorting, or selection happens outside of ValueLens.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="in-short">
      <h2 id="in-short">In Short:</h2>
      <p>ValueLens makes certain value components visible in a consistent way. How that information is used for evaluating an option is up to the person or system viewing it.</p>
